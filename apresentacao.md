mapreduce for incremental

incoop techniques

challenges: transparency
challenges: efficiency

Inc-HDFS

Incremental Map (first run VS second/further runs)

Incremental Reduce


Questions:

diferent aditional phases plain hadoop 
memoazation and contration
contration performs it stuff automatically/manually ?

what would be a better decision for this automatically
lots of grained or less but bigger inputs (similar, esta nos results)

memoization, what is it ?
what happens if we skip it ?
prevent repeated computations (cached value)
we will degrain to base regular mapreduce
